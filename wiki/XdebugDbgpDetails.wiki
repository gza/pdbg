#summary What is Xdebug's support of DBGp like?

= Introduction =

Xdebug's support of DBGp is not complete. Some core commands and many extended commands are not supported. This page details Xdebug's DBGp support.

== General Issues

  * How errors are handled is inconsistent (ie some set an attribute on response, some put a message in a node in response).
  * There is no way to know from typemap_get which types can be set with property_set.

== Core Commands ==

=== stderr ===

This command is not supported at all. The implementation in the Xdebug source is just a hardcoded error response. (2.0.3)

=== property_get ===

This command does not return a dollar sign prefix on variable names, whereas context_get does.

=== property_set ===

The implementation of this command sets the success attribute twice on an unsupported type. this causes lxml to puke an exception.

== Extended Commands ==

=== eval ===

Supported by Xdebug. When the resulting property value is an array, only the first dimension of the array is returned. (2.0.3)

=== expr ===

Not supported (2.0.3)
